Simple spun lights originally designed for the Toronto retail space Working Title. The lights are spun in Ontario from 16 gauge polished stainless steel. 

Marrying the vernacular of traditional Japanese lanterns and stamped car parts, the lights create a paradox that is both delicate and industrial.
