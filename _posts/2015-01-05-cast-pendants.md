Inspired by traditional plumb weights, these cast aluminum pendants are designed to be used as single pendants or in cluster configurations. The addition of a splitter allows for many combinations. The light provides direct downwards light using a G8 LED light bulb.

The use of LED technology allows for a surprisingly small scale, each light only measures 10-13cm tall. The cast pendants are designed for both commercial and residential use.
