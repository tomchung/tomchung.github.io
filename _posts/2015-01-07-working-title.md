Working Title is a menswear store and project space located in the Yorkville neighbourhood of Toronto. Housed in an old anti-aging shop, the project scope included the interior design and custom fixtures for the first floor of the retail space.

Canadian Douglas Fir, polished stainless steel, tempered glass and maple plywood have been used in reference to the lumber and auto industries that surround Ontario. Custom fixtures including, stools, benches and a large display desk are mixed with vintage pieces that mimic the polished stainless steel framework.

The ceiling and floor was torn up to expose the original terrazzo and wood beams. The layout responds to the ad hoc nature of the store and functional needs to be re-arranged for exhibitions and events. The fixtures and materials follow the idea of a "working" or studio space as the format for the store.
