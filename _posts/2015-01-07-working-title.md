Working Title is a menswear store and project space located in the Yorkville neighbourhood of Toronto. Housed in an old anti-aging shop, the project scope included the interior design and custom fixtures for the first floor of the retail space.

The ceiling and floor was exposed up to reveal the original terrazzo and wood beams. The layout responds to the ad hoc nature of the store and functional needs to be re-arranged for exhibitions and events. The fixtures and materials follow the idea of a "working" or studio space as the format for the store.
