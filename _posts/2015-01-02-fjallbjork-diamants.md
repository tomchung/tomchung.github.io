With the simple action of cutting, the Cabinet Maker crafts a precious object out of the most common and traditional Swedish material; Birch wood offcuts.

Cut by the Carl Malmsten School, the Birch Diamond with its wood-waste box, overturns the traditional ideas of luxury and uniqueness with a new material expression of the object. This diamond tells the story of a new possible ethical dimension of design and craftsmanship.

Construction and fabrication were executed by Hannes Lundin, Kim S&otilde;derbergh, Lone Ohlin and Magnus Dahl&eacute;n under the supervision of Leif Burman. Produced in an edition of 50.
