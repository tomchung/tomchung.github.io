Sitting Room was an interdisciplinary exhibition of emerging Canadian Designers & Artists organized and curated for the 2015 Toronto Design Offsite festival.
The exhibition investigated living spaces as an intersection of artistic discipline. The space featured a temporary built environment that pulled together work from different mediums presented within a simulated domestic context.

Works by Knauf & Brown, Mercury Bureau, Rodrigo Caula, Andy Chung, Anh Dao, Jordan Murphy, & Lambert Rainville.
