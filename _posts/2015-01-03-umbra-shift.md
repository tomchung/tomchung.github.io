Umbra Shift is a contemporary sub-brand of Umbra targeting influencing design stores and independent retailers. The brand was conceived and managed by Tom Chung for the first two releases including product selection, product design and art direction.

"Umbra Shift is an extension of Umbra that focuses on contemporary influences in the design community. For more than 30 years, Umbra has broken the mould by creating entirely new categories that apply thoughtful design to everyday items. Umbra Shift revisits these roots with a roster of established, emerging, and in-house designers who share Umbra's passion to re-think things, designing personal objects they themselves would want to give or use at home. The result is a collection that expresses diverse points of view, yet sits together with a shared belief in ideas that are functional, familiar and forward thinking."
